The program DRAGON consists of several files.

In the directory named "data" the data used for cross section computation are stored in some ASCII files.
  Spalation cross sections come from Evoli-2019 (called DRAGON2 default option).
  Antiprotons cross sections come from Winkler-2017.
  Leptons are taken from the Kamae routine.
  Inelastic cross sections are taken from the CROSEC routines for nuclei down to He and the parametrization given in Kafexhiu, E., Aharonian, F., Taylor, A. M., & Vila, G. S. (2014). Physical Review D, 90(12), 123014.
  
In the directory "output" the results of the program are stored. DRAGON accepts in input a string that uniquely identifies the run. 
The output is twofold: as an ASCII file and as fits files.

Please ignore the *Dict* files, which are only needed for the printout to be stored in ROOT files.

The driver program can be found in dragon.cc, but the actual core of DRAGON is the the 2 files named "main_class.cc" and 
"include/main_class.h", since in there the C++ class CRevolutor, which takes care of the solution of the diffusion equation, is 
defined and implemented.

The file "utils.cc" is just an helper with some functions not included as class member functions.
