The file crxsecs_fragmentation_Evoli2019_cumulative_modified.dat is the table that contains the DRAGON2 default spallation cross sections.

The files Winkler-ap are the tables with the production cross sections of antiprotons 
(taken from Winkler, M. W. (2017). Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, 2017(02), 048.).

The files galprop_WNEWTR_082693.CDR.dat, webber_xsec.dat and webber_xsec_total.dat contain the information required in the 
fortran files for the WNEW and YIELDX respectively (these routines are used in when choosing the Webber03 option of spallation XSecs).
 
The fits file MilkyWay_DR0.5_DZ0.1_DPHI10_RMAX20_ZMAX5_galprop_format.fits.gz contains the Galprop spatial gas distribution.

Finally, the isotope list contains the list of isotopes and its decay time and decay channels (when they are unstable) the 
code needs to read.
